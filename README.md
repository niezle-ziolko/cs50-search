## Project Requirements

### Website Structure

Your site must include a minimum of three distinct pages:

1. A page dedicated to standard Google Search functionality.
2. A page for Google Image Search.
3. A page for Google Advanced Search.

The Google Search page should feature navigation links in the upper-right corner that direct users to either the Image Search or Advanced Search pages. Similarly, both the Image Search and Advanced Search pages should provide a link in the same position to return to the main Google Search page.

### Search Functionality

1. **Standard Search**:
   - The Google Search page must allow users to input a search query.
   - Upon clicking a "Search" button, users should be redirected to the appropriate Google results page.
   - The search bar should:
     - Be centered on the page.
     - Have rounded corners.
     - Include the search button directly below it.

2. **Image Search**:
   - The Image Search page should enable users to enter a query and perform a search by clicking a designated button.
   - This action should redirect users to Google Image results relevant to their query.

3. **Advanced Search**:
   - The Advanced Search page must include input fields for the following criteria:
     - Pages containing **all** specified words.
     - Pages containing an **exact phrase**.

     - Pages excluding specified words.
   - The layout should:

3. **Localization**:
   - Display text indicating the country from which the visit is supported.

4. **Virtual Keyboard**:
   - Provide a virtual keyboard to type search phrases without using a physical keyboard.

5. **Voice Search**:
   - Implement voice search functionality, allowing users to input search phrases using their voice.
